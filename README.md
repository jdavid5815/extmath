Extended Math Functions. This little library was developed as an aid for solving problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). It might be extended if the need arises or when I find some time to solve a few more Euler Project problems.

## *func Gcd(uint, uint) uint*

Returns the Greatest Common Divisor of two unsigned integers.

## *func Factorial(int) int*

Returns the factorial for the given integer.

## *func Lcm(uint, uint) uint*

Returns the Least Common Multiple of two unsigned integers.

## *func PrimeFactorization(int) ([]int)*

Given a positive integer, return all the prime factors in a slice of integers.

## *func Primes(int) ([]int)*

Provide a positive integer and the function will return all primes up to that given integer, in a slice of integers.
